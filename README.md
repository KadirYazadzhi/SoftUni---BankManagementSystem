## 💡 **Project Insights**

This project is a practical example of managing multiple bank accounts and transactions using object-oriented principles in C#. It helps in understanding basic banking operations, data management, and secure user interactions.

## 🎓 **Credits**

This project is based on the **"Bank Account Management System"** exercise created by [Mario Zahariev](https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof/) for Python developers. However, I adapted the task and implemented it in C#. You can view the original task [here](https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof/python-fundamentals-09-2024-/blob/main/Bank%20Account%20Management%20System.md).

Special thanks to Mario Zahariev for providing a great foundational exercise.
